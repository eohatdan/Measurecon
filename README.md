# Measurecon
Python module to convert measurements from one unit (e.g. cup) to another (e.g. liter) and to compute energy equivalent for units in Joules.
This module illustrates how to do the following:
- Load a dictionary from a JSON file.
- Convert between units of measure using the dictionary and the technique of having a common measure (cubic centimeters) to avoid the O(n^2) possible combinations.
- Using TKinter as a means of creating a GUI for the module.
- Importing a class from a different module.
